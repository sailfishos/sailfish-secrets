The files in this directory were copied directly from src/sql/drivers/sqlite/
in the qtbase repository. Licensing information is provided at the top of
each file.

If you build this plugin against a Qt version other than that stated in
../README.md, you may need to replace these files with the ones from that
version of Qt.
