Qt SQL driver plugin for SQLCipher
==================================

This is a [QSqlDriverPlugin](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsqldriverplugin.html) for
[SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/open-source/). It is quite
simple - it uses Qt's own SQLite driver code but links against SQLCipher
instead of SQLite.

Please see the [Upstream Repository](https://github.com/sijk/qt5-sqlcipher)
for the original code, as this is a slightly modified copy (Qt 5.6.3 based,
no tests, no CMake).


## Dependencies

- Qt 5
- SQLCipher
- CMake >= 3.0
- pkg-config


## Tested platforms

- OS X 10.10 Yosemite

    - Qt 5.5.0 from Homebrew
    - SQLCipher 3.3.0 from Homebrew

- Ubuntu 15.04 Vivid Vervet

    - Qt 5.4.1
    - SQLCipher 3.2.0
    - Also requires ``qtbase5-private-dev`` for Qt's private headers.


## Deployment

Follow [Qt's plugin deployment guide](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/deployment-plugins.html).
In short, put the plugin at ``sqldrivers/libqsqlcipher.so`` relative to your
executable.


## Static linking

You can also build the plugin statically by passing ``-DSTATIC=ON`` to CMake.
When you build your application which uses the static plugin, you'll need to
include the line ``Q_IMPORT_PLUGIN(QSQLCipherDriverPlugin);`` in one of your
source files and define ``QT_STATICPLUGIN`` at compile time. And link to the
static plugin, of course.

Note that setting ``-DSTATIC=ON`` only builds *this plugin* as a static library.
If you also want to link to static versions of Qt and/or SQLCipher, it's up to
you to make sure CMake finds static versions of those libraries.


## Tests

Some basic tests are included - run ``make test``. Note that while pretty much
any C++ compiler can build the actual plugin, the tests require support for
C++14. If you have an old compiler you can pass ``-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF`` to CMake
to skip building the tests.

## Old version

This repository used to contain a different method of achieving the same
result, but which required you to have the full Qt source tree available. That
code is available in the ``old`` branch of this repository.
