\title Default Crypto Plugins for the Sailfish OS Secrets and Crypto Framework

A number of plugins have been written for the framework which provide
a variety of functionality for clients to use.  Most clients should use
the platform default plugins when writing their applications, as these
will provide the most consistent and secure experience.

Device vendors and trusted partners may wish to provide their own plugins,
and some applications may wish to specifically use those plugins.

\section1 Default Crypto Plugins

Currently, there are two Sailfish OS Crypto plugins shipped by default:

\list
\li org.sailfishos.crypto.plugin.crypto.openssl
\li org.sailfishos.secrets.plugin.encryptedstorage.sqlcipher
\endlist

The first plugin provides implementations of common cryptography functionality
by calling the OpenSSL library functions internally.

The second plugin shares its cryptography implementation with the first plugin,
but also provides block-level encrypted secure storage of collections of
secrets, using the SQLCipher library for its database operations.  Thus it is
both a \tt{Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoPlugin} and a
\tt{Sailfish::Secrets::EncryptedStoragePlugin}.

Note that neither of these plugins use TEE/TPM or other secure-hardware
to implement the cryptographic functionality.

\section1 Which Plugin Should My Application Use?

We recommend that the system default CryptoStorage plugin be used where
possible.  In most cases, this will be the
"org.sailfishos.secrets.plugin.encryptedstorage.sqlcipher" plugin.

The following snippet shows an example of using the default crypto
storage plugin to create a symmetric key, and store it in an encrypted
database managed by that same plugin:

\code
// Set the key template metadata.
Sailfish::Crypto::Key keyTemplate, symmetricKeyReference;
keyTemplate.setAlgorithm(Sailfish::Crypto::Key::Aes256);
keyTemplate.setOrigin(Sailfish::Crypto::Key::OriginDevice);
keyTemplate.setBlockModes(Sailfish::Crypto::Key::BlockModeCBC);
keyTemplate.setEncryptionPaddings(Sailfish::Crypto::Key::EncryptionPaddingNone);
keyTemplate.setSignaturePaddings(Sailfish::Crypto::Key::SignaturePaddingNone);
keyTemplate.setDigests(Sailfish::Crypto::Key::DigestSha256);
keyTemplate.setOperations(Sailfish::Crypto::Key::Encrypt
                         |Sailfish::Crypto::Key::Decrypt);

// Set the identifier for the key.
// This assumes the existence of an "ExampleCollection" secure storage
// collection, in which the key will be stored.
// See Sailfish::Secrets::SecretManager::createCollection().
keyTemplate.setIdentifier(QStringLiteral("ExampleKey"),
                          QStringLiteral("ExampleCollection"));

// Ask the system service to generate and store the key securely.
Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager cm;
QDBusPendingReply<Sailfish::Crypto::Result, Sailfish::Crypto::Key>
        generateReply = cm.generateStoredKey(
                keyTemplate,
                Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager::DefaultCryptoStoragePluginName);
generateReply.waitForFinished();
if (generateReply.argumentAt<0>().code() == Sailfish::Crypto::Result::Failed) {
    qWarning() << "Unable to generate and store symmetric key:"
               << generateReply.argumentAt<0>().errorMessage();
} else {
    symmetricKeyReference = generateReply.argumentAt<1>();
}
\endcode

Note that this example assumes that the "ExampleCollection" had already
been created, via the appropriate call to
\tt{Sailfish::Secrets::SecretManager::createCollection()}.
