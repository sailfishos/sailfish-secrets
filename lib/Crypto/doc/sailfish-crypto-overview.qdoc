\title Sailfish OS Crypto Library

The Sailfish OS Crypto Library provides applications with API to access the
cryptography functionality offered by the system service daemon as part of the
Sailfish OS Secrets and Crypto Framework.

\note The Sailfish OS Secrets and Crypto Framework is still in active
development and is subject to change.  Normal 3rd party API backward
compatibility promises don't hold.
Follow \l{https://forum.sailfishos.org/}{Sailfish OS Forum} release notes
to get notified of API changes.

\section1 Sailfish OS Crypto Architecture

Applications running on highly-connected devices require the capability to
perform advanced cryptographic operations, in order to protect the user's data,
authenticate with remote services, verify the authenticity of other connected
devices, and communicate securely.  The keys and certificates which are used
to perform such operations also need to be stored securely on the device, in
order to prevent malicious third-party applications from accessing those keys.

In order to provide this capability, Sailfish OS includes a system service
(extensible via vendor-specific plugins) which offers both secure storage of
keys and the ability to perform cryptographic operations on behalf of client
applications.  Client applications access this service via the Sailfish OS
Crypto Library, which provides an asynchronous API for performing a variety
of operations (and hides the IPC used as an internal implementation detail).

Applications using the Sailfish OS Secrets and Crypto Framework delegate
cryptographic operations to the system service, and the framework has been
designed to ensure that when used appropriately, secret key data need never
enter the process address space of the application. Furthermore, if the
cryptographic service provider plugin to the framework is backed by secure
hardware, Trusted Execution Environment application, or Trusted Platform
Module, then secret key data need never enter the normal "rich" execution
environment.

\section1 Using the Sailfish OS Crypto Library

As described in the Sailfish OS Secrets and Crypto Framework overview
documentation, client applications can use the Sailfish OS Crypto Library
in order to make use of the cryptographic services provided by the
Sailfish OS Secrets and Crypto Framework.

This library provides client applications written in C++ (with Qt) with API to
make use of the cryptographic services provided by the Sailfish OS Secrets and
Crypto Framework.

To make use of this library, applications should depend on the
"sailfishcrypto.pc" pkgconfig file.

e.g. in a qmake-based project:

\code
CONFIG += link_pkgconfig
PKGCONFIG += sailfishcrypto
\endcode

\section2 Client API

The client API consists of a variety of C++ classes which represent the
inputs to cryptographic operations (including public, private and secret keys),
the result of a cryptographic operation (that is, whether it succeeded or
failed, along with some information about the reason for the failure),
and one class which provides an interface to the remote service.

\list
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::Key} represents a (possibly partial or reference) cryptographic key
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::Key::Identifier} consists of a key name and optionally a collection name
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::Result} represents the result (but not the output) of a cryptographic operation
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager} provides an interface to the system cryptography service
\endlist

In order to perform a cryptographic operation, clients must request that the
system service perform the operation on their behalf, and either return the
result to them, or store it securely.  There are a variety of request-specific
classes which provide this functionality:

\list
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::PluginInfoRequest} to retrieve information about crypto plugins
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::SeedRandomDataGeneratorRequest} to seed a crypto plugin's random number generator
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::GenerateRandomDataRequest} to generate random data
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::GenerateInitializationVectorRequest} to generate an initialization vector for use in encryption or decryption
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::GenerateKeyRequest} to generate a \l{Sailfish::Crypto::Key}{Key}
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::GenerateStoredKeyRequest} to generate a securely-stored \l{Sailfish::Crypto::Key}{Key}
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::ImportKeyRequest} to import a \l{Sailfish::Crypto::Key}{Key} from a data file
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::ImportStoredKeyRequest} to import a \l{Sailfish::Crypto::Key}{Key} from a data file and store it securely
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::StoredKeyRequest} to retrieve a securely-stored \l{Sailfish::Crypto::Key}{Key}
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::StoredKeyIdentifiersRequest} to retrieve the identifiers of securely-stored \l{Sailfish::Crypto::Key}{Keys}
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::DeleteStoredKeyRequest} to delete a securely-stored \l{Sailfish::Crypto::Key}{Key}
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::EncryptRequest} to encrypt data with a given \l{Sailfish::Crypto::Key}{Key}
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::DecryptRequest} to decrypt data with a given \l{Sailfish::Crypto::Key}{Key}
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::CalculateDigestRequest} to calculate a digest (non-keyed hash) of some data
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::SignRequest} to generate a signature for some data with a given \l{Sailfish::Crypto::Key}{Key}
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::VerifyRequest} to verify if a signature was generated with a given \l{Sailfish::Crypto::Key}{Key}
\li \l{Sailfish::Crypto::CipherRequest} to start a cipher session with which to encrypt, decrypt, sign or verify a stream of data
\endlist

\section3 Usage Examples

The examples directory in the source repository contains a variety of examples
of usage of the Sailfish OS Crypto Library as well as the Sailfish OS Secrets
Library.  Please see those for complete, working examples.

Some snippets showing commonly-required functionality are included below.

\section4 Generating a securely-stored symmetric cipher key

This snippet shows how to generate a symmetric cipher key which will be stored
securely by the Sailfish OS Secrets and Crypto Framework. It assumes that a
secure storage collection has previously been created, in which to store the
key. Please see the Sailfish OS Secrets Library documentation for information
about how to create such a collection.

First, the client defines the algorithm, supported block modes, supported
padding schemes, and supported operations in a template key.  That template key
is given an identifier which includes the name of the key and the name of the
secure storage collection in which it should be stored, and is then set as a
parameter in the GenerateStoredKeyRequest instance, which, when started,
results in an IPC call to the secure Sailfish OS Secrets and Crypto Framework
system service.

The Sailfish OS Secrets and Crypto Framework system service will then delegate
the operation to the specified crypto plugin, which in turn will generate a
full symmetric key based upon the given template, and store it securely.  A
reference key (that is, a key containing a valid identifier and metadata, but
no secret key data) will be returned to the client application.

Note that these operations are all asynchronous, however in the snippet we
force the operation to be synchronous by calling the \tt{waitForFinished()}
method of the request object.  In practice, the client application should
instead listen to the signals which notify when the operation is complete.

\code
// Set the key template metadata.
Sailfish::Crypto::Key keyTemplate, symmetricKeyReference;
keyTemplate.setAlgorithm(Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager::AlgorithmAes);
keyTemplate.setSize(256);
keyTemplate.setOrigin(Sailfish::Crypto::Key::OriginDevice);
keyTemplate.setOperations(Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager::OperationEncrypt
                         |Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager::OperationDecrypt);

// Set the identifier for the key.
// This assumes the existence of an "ExampleCollection" secure storage
// collection, in which the key will be stored.
// See Sailfish::Secrets::CreateCollectionRequest.
keyTemplate.setIdentifier(
        Sailfish::Crypto::Key::Identifier(
                QStringLiteral("ExampleKey"),
                QStringLiteral("ExampleCollection"),
                Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager::DefaultCryptoStoragePluginName));

// Ask the system service to generate and store the key securely.
Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager cm;
Sailfish::Crypto::GenerateStoredKeyRequest generateRequest;
generateRequest.setManager(&cm);
generateRequest.setKeyTemplate(keyTemplate);
generateRequest.setCryptoPluginName(Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager::DefaultCryptoStoragePluginName);
generateRequest.startRequest();
generateRequest.waitForFinished();
if (generateRequest.result().code() == Sailfish::Crypto::Result::Failed) {
    qWarning() << "Unable to generate and store symmetric key:"
               << generateRequest.result().errorMessage();
} else {
    symmetricKeyReference = generateRequest.generatedKeyReference();
}
\endcode

\section4 Encrypting data with a symmetric key

After generating a symmetric key, that key may be used to encrypt data.
Note that the key may be either a key reference (that is, a key which contains
only metadata and a valid identifier, which references a full key stored in
secure storage) or a full key (that is, a key which contains secret key data).

In this example, we use the reference key which was returned to the application
in the previous snippet.

\code
QByteArray iv, ciphertext, plaintext = "Example plaintext data";

GenerateInitializationVectorRequest ivRequest;
ivRequest.setManager(&cm);
ivRequest.setAlgorithm(symmetricKeyReference.algorithm());
ivRequest.setKeySize(symmetricKeyReference.size());
ivRequest.setBlockMode(Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager::BlockModeCbc);
ivRequest.setCryptoPluginName(Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager::DefaultCryptoStoragePluginName);
ivRequest.startRequest();
ivRequest.waitForFinished();
if (ivRequest.result().code() == Sailfish::Crypto::Result::Failed) {
    qWarning() << "Failed to generate initialization vector:"
               << ivRequest.result().errorMessage();
} else {
    iv = ivRequest.generatedInitializationVector();
}

EncryptRequest encryptRequest;
encryptRequest.setManager(&cm);
encryptRequest.setData(plaintext);
encryptRequest.setInitializationVector(iv);
encryptRequest.setKey(symmetricKeyReference);
encryptRequest.setBlockMode(Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager::BlockModeCbc);
encryptRequest.setPadding(Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager::EncryptionPaddingNone);
encryptRequest.setCryptoPluginName(Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager::DefaultCryptoStoragePluginName);
encryptRequest.startRequest();
encryptRequest.waitForFinished();
if (encryptRequest.result().code() == Sailfish::Crypto::Result::Failed) {
    qWarning() << "Failed to encrypt:"
               << encryptRequest.result().errorMessage();
} else {
    ciphertext = encryptRequest.ciphertext();
}
\endcode

\section4 Decrypting data with a symmetric key

A symmetric key may also be used to decrypt data.  In the following snippet,
the client asks the system service to decrypt the ciphertext with the same
key reference, to produce decrypted data.

\code
DecryptRequest decryptRequest;
decryptRequest.setManager(&cm);
decryptRequest.setData(ciphertext);
decryptRequest.setInitializationVector(iv);
decryptRequest.setKey(symmetricKeyReference);
decryptRequest.setBlockMode(Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager::BlockModeCbc);
decryptRequest.setPadding(Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager::EncryptionPaddingNone);
decryptRequest.setCryptoPluginName(Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoManager::DefaultCryptoStoragePluginName);
decryptRequest.startRequest();
decryptRequest.waitForFinished();
if (decryptRequest.result().code() == Sailfish::Crypto::Result::Failed) {
    qWarning() << "Failed to decrypt ciphertext:"
               << decryptRequest.result().errorMessage();
} else {
    QByteArray decrypted = decryptRequest.plaintext();
    qDebug() << "Decrypted:" << decrypted;
}
\endcode

\section1 Extending the Sailfish OS Secrets and Crypto Framework with Crypto Plugins

The Sailfish OS Crypto Library also provides a plugin base-class which may be
extended by device vendors or trusted partners to allow them to build plugins
to extend the Sailfish OS Secrets and Crypto Framework with additional
cryptography functionality (for example, supporting different algorithms or
block modes, or performing the operations via a Trusted Execution Environment
application rather than in-process in the rich application process).

The \l{Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoPlugin} class should be extended in order to
achieve this, and the resulting plugin should be installed into the
\tt{/usr/lib/Sailfish/Crypto/} directory.

Note that if you wish to provide secure key storage as well as cryptographic
services to clients, you also need to extend
\c Sailfish::Secrets::EncryptedStoragePlugin.  For more information about that
topic, please see the documentation about the Sailfish OS Secrets library.

A variety of crypto plugins are shipped by default with the framework, and
these are documented at the page about
\l{Default Crypto Plugins for the Sailfish OS Secrets and Crypto Framework}.

One of these in particular is useful to use as an example or basic template,
and that is the ExampleUsbTokenPlugin which can be found in the source tree.
