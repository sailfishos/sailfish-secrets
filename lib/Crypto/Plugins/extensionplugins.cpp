SAILFISH_CRYPTO_API Q_LOGGING_CATEGORY(lcSailfishCryptoPlugin, "org.sailfishos.crypto.daemon.plugin", QtWarningMsg)

/*!
  \class CryptoPlugin
  \brief Specifies an interface which provides a variety of cryptographic
         operations to clients which will be exposed via the Sailfish OS
         Crypto API.
  \inmodule SailfishCrypto
  \inheaderfile Crypto/Plugins/extensionplugins.h

  The CryptoPlugin type specifies an interface which provides encryption,
  decryption, signing, verification, key derivation, key pair generation,
  random data generation, and digest calculation.

  The interface also includes methods related to key storage and retrieval,
  for those plugins which include external key storage capability (which
  offers the maximum security for stored keys as they need never be pulled
  into the secrets daemon process address space).  Note that if a plugin
  implements these methods, it must also implement the
  Sailfish::Secrets::EncryptedStoragePlugin interface from the Sailfish OS
  Secrets Extension Plugin API.  Any plugin which implements both of these
  interfaces is known as a Crypto Storage Plugin (for an example of such a
  plugin, please see the ExampleUsbTokenPlugin in the source tree).

  Plugin implementers must be aware that the information reporting methods
  (encryptionType(), and canStoreKeys()) will be invoked from the main
  thread of the secrets daemon, while the various interface operation methods
  will be invoked from a separate thread.  Plugins are loaded and plugin
  instances are constructed in the main thread.

  In order to implement a Crypto extension plugin, plugin implementers should
  specify the following in their .pro file:
  \code
  CONFIG += link_pkgconfig
  PKGCONFIG += sailfishcryptopluginapi
  \endcode

  The CryptoPlugin class extends the Sailfish::Secrets::PluginBase abstract
  base class, and the sailfishcryptopluginapi pkgconfig file will entail
  a dependency upon sailfishsecretspluginapi and sailfishsecrets, as
  well as sailfishcrypto.

  An example (skeleton) Crypto plugin without key storage capability may be
  found at: https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-secrets/tree/master/examples/plugins/examplecryptoplugin/

  If the specified \a blockMode is an authenticated mode (such as GCM)
  then the client should also have provided \a authenticationData, and upon
  successfully decrypting the input \a data the plugin should also calculate
  the authentication tag and compare it to the given \a authenticationTag to
  see if it matches, and should write the comparison result to the
  \a verificationStatus out-parameter.  Note that if the decryption succeeded but the
  authentication tag comparison failed, the result of the operation should
  still be Sailfish::Crypto::Result::Succeeded, but clients are required to
  explicitly check the value of the \a verificationStatus out-parameter to determine
  whether the input data had been tampered with by an attacker.

  The \a key may be either a full key (that is, containing private or secret
  key data) which may be directly used to perform the decryption operation,
  or it may be a key reference (that is, containing only metadata, including
  an identifier) in which case (if it is a reference to a valid key stored
  by the plugin) the full key it identifies should be retrieved from storage
  and used to perform the operation.

  Depending on the type of \a operation the client wishes to perform, some
  of the input parameters may not be applicable (e.g. the \a iv might be
  applicable only for encrypt and decrypt operations, and then only if the
  key is a symmetric key and the \a blockMode requires an initialization
  vector to be provided; similarly the \a signaturePadding parameter would
  only be applicable for sign and verify operations; etc).

  Note that if the cipher session operation is decryption with a symmetric
  algorithm and the block mode is GCM and the decryption succeeded but the
  verification failed, the plugin should still return a
  Sailfish::Crypto::Result with the result code set to
  Sailfish::Crypto::Result::Succeeded (as it was successfully able to
  decrypt the input data, and determine that the input data had been
  tampered with).  In that case, the client must check the value of the
  \a verificationStatus out-parameter to ascertain whether or not the decrypted
  data can be trusted.
