/*!
  \class PluginBase
  \brief Provides the base interface for extension plugins for the Sailfish OS Secrets and Crypto Framework.
  \inmodule SailfishSecrets
  \inheaderfile Secrets/Plugins/extensionplugins.h

  PluginBase is an abstract base class which provides an interface which all extension plugins
  must implement.  This interface includes some information about the plugin (including its
  name and version, and whether or not it supports locking), as well as locking operation methods.

  Extension plugins are loaded by the Sailfish OS Secrets and Crypto Framework daemon, and
  the functionality of those plugins is exposed to clients via the Secrets and Crypto API.

  There are a variety of extension plugin types which each extend PluginBase,
  which define specific interfaces which concrete derived types must implement.
  A list of the available Secrets extension plugin types follows:

  \list
  \li \l{Sailfish::Secrets::AuthenticationPlugin} perform suser authentication and verification
  \li \l{Sailfish::Secrets::EncryptionPlugin} encrypts secret data for secrets stored in a \l{Sailfish::Secrets::StoragePlugin}
  \li \l{Sailfish::Secrets::StoragePlugin} provides unencrypted storage for secrets
  \li \l{Sailfish::Secrets::EncryptedStoragePlugin} provides encrypted storage for secrets
  \endlist

  In addition, there also exists the \c Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoPlugin extension plugin type,
  which provides cryptographic functionality to clients (See the Sailfish OS Crypto library
  documentation for more details).  If a particular plugin implements
  both the \c Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoPlugin and \l{Sailfish::Secrets::EncryptedStoragePlugin}
  interfaces then it is able to secure store cryptographic keys as well as perform cryptographic
  operations using those keys, and is referred to as a Crypto-Storage Plugin.

  Plugin implementers should not extend PluginBase directly, but should instead derive from
  one of the above-listed plugin types (or both CryptoPlugin and EncryptedStoragePlugin if
  they are implementing a Crypto-Storage plugin).

  Plugin implementers must be aware that the information reporting methods (name(), version(),
  supportsLocking(), and supportsSetLockCode()) will be invoked from the main thread of the
  secrets daemon, while the various locking operation methods (isLocked(), lock(), unlock(),
  and setLockCode()) and availability reporting method (isAvailable()) will be invoked from a
  separate thread.  Plugins are loaded and plugin instances are constructed in the main thread.

  In order to implement a Secrets extension plugin, plugin implementers should
  specify the following in their .pro file:
  \code
  CONFIG += link_pkgconfig
  PKGCONFIG += sailfishsecretspluginapi
  \endcode

  An example (skeleton) Encrypted Storage plugin (which also implements the
  \c{CryptoPlugin} interface) may be found at:
  https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-secrets/tree/master/examples/plugins/examplecryptostorageplugin/
 */

/*!
  \fn PluginBase::displayName() const
  \brief Return the translated display name of the plugin

  This name will be shown to the user of the device in system prompts when
  an attempt is made to access a secret or key stored within the plugin.
  It should be a human-readable string, which is informative for the user,
  and may need to be translated into different languages if the display
  name is not a proper noun.

  For example, the example encrypted storage plugin based on SQLCipher
  has the display name "SQLCipher".
 */

/*!
  \fn PluginBase::name() const
  \brief Return the name of the plugin

  This name must be globally unique, so a fully-qualified-domain-name
  prefix is recommended.

  For example, the example encrypted storage plugin based on SQLCipher
  has the name: "org.sailfishos.secrets.encryptedstorage.sqlcipher".
 */

  Plugin implementers must document to clients the semantics of every
  operation they offer through the Sailfish::Secrets or Sailfish::Crypto
  APIs.  Given that the semantics of the implementation may change from
  version to version, the version of the plugin must be reported
  programmatically.

  \class EncryptedStoragePlugin
  \brief Specifies an interface allowing storage and retrieval of secrets
         into and from an encrypted backing store.
  \inmodule SailfishSecrets
  \inheaderfile Secrets/Plugins/extensionplugins.h

  The EncryptedStoragePlugin type specifies an interface which includes a
  variety of operations on secrets and collections of secrets, where the
  underlying storage is encrypted (e.g. block-level file encryption using
  SQLCipher, or an encrypted USB device).

  The basic mode of operation of this type of plugin is that either the
  entire storage will need to be unlocked (via the \l PluginBase::unlock()
  method) or a specific collection will need to be unlocked (via the
  \l setEncryptionKey() method) before data can be read from or written
  to the storage.  See the included SQLCipher-based plugin for an example
  of a plugin which supports per-collection locking (via setEncryptionKey()).

  If a plugin implements both the EncryptedStoragePlugin interface and the
  Sailfish::Crypto::CryptoPlugin interface, it is referred to as a
  crypto-storage plugin (and can store or provides cryptographic keys for
  use by clients).  See the included example USB token plugin for an example
  of a plugin which provides built-in encryption keys and requires storage
  unlocking, and implements both the EncryptedStoragePlugin and CryptoPlugin
  interfaces.

  flow in-process) then it should delegate the operation to the service
  whose (peer to peer) DBus address is given as \a interactionServiceAddress.
  Otherwise, the \a interactionServiceAddress parameter should be ignored.

  The \a interactionParameters will contain a variety of parameters which
  specify the type of input which is wanted from the user, as well as the
  look and feel of any user interaction prompt which is required (e.g.
  the echo mode of input characters, etc).

  When complete, the plugin should emit the userInputInteractionCompleted()
  signal, with the result parameter having an appropriate result code set
  and the user's input provided.

  If the plugin itself is locked, this function should return a
  Sailfish::Secrets::Result with the result code set to
  Sailfish::Secrets::Result::Failed and the error code set to
  Sailfish::Secrets::Result::SecretsPluginIsLockedError.
